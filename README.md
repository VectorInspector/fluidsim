Displayed is vortex shedding in a wind tunnel setting.

It uses LOVE2D and Lua for the implementation. The type of fluid is a grid-based algorithm based on the regular divergence free Navier-Stokes equation, which was simplified to take only diffusion, advection and outside forces into account. Effectively it becomes an Euler fluid simulation. Obstacles to obstruct the fluid movement are possible.
